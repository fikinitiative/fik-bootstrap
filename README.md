FIK STORES BOOTSTRAP

FEATURES

We’ve built the Fik Stores  Bootstrap theme so that it could be used as-is or as a starting point for theme developers. It’s built on top of work from brilliant developers, see the credits section.

Star this project on Github to keep up with its progress.

    - Homepage template (seen on the homepage of this site)
    - Standard page with right sidebar (this page)
    - Page with left sidebar
    - Full width page

Theme Options Panel

Want to change some colors? Want the top nav to scroll with the content? Hide the search box in the top nav? Do it in the options panel.
